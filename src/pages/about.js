      <h2>Hi Im Andrew & I am addicted to development</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since I was young I have loved figuring things out, how they work,
        how it was made, and can it be better. These things have constantly
        driven me to learn and improve all my life Im that annoying guy in your
        class that always ask why. Building things, solving problems, and
        process improvment is my cup of tea so if thats your cup too or you
        would like something special built give me a holler. Thanks for reading
        and I hope we will talk soon!
